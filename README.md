# MovieLens Recommendation System

This project implements a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques on the MovieLens dataset. The recommendation system suggests personalized movie recommendations to users based on their past preferences and behavior.

## Features

- User-based collaborative filtering
- Item-based collaborative filtering
- Evaluation metrics: RMSE, coverage, diversity

## Dataset

The MovieLens dataset contains movie ratings and tags applied by users. It consists of 20 million ratings and 465,000 tag applications across 27,000 movies, created by 138,000 users.

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: Download the MovieLens dataset and preprocess the data (cleaning, feature engineering).

2. **Model Training**: Train user-based and item-based collaborative filtering models using the prepared data.

3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the models using metrics such as RMSE, coverage, and diversity.

## Dependencies

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Surprise (for collaborative filtering)
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/SakshiFadnavis2003/movielens-recommendation-system.git
cd movielens-recommendation-system
